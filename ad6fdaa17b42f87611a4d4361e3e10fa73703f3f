      "message": "struct state itself is on the stack (as part of copytool private, `struct client client` in clients or directly `struct state state` on coordinatool), so never freed for itself.\n\nIts members should be freed if dynamically allocated though and I probably missed some.\nIf you spot some in clients it should be added in common code and hooked before free(ct) in preload/preload.c and before normal exit for client/client.c\n\nFor server the main loop has no normal exit, but it would be useful for debugging memory leaks eventually -- it would make sense to add either a sigterm handler to properly exit or a terminate message from client for that.",
