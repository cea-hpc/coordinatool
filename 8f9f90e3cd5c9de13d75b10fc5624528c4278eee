      "message": "question: just to be sure I understand this correctly. You set the time in timer_rearm to trigger for the client which will expire the grace period first. Then when this callback is called, you will disconnect the client for good. I don\u0027t remember if that\u0027s already done but I assume that if the client reconnects before the time is triggered, it will be removed from the desconnected_clients list, right? Which means that it won\u0027t be disconnected.",
