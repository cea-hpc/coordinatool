Do you intend to merge this at some point?\n\nIt would be nice if you could add me to the reviewers when you push patches. I don\u0027t really  have the time to do a proper review but at least I would stay uptodate on the code base. I\u0027ve lost track a bit recently... That being said, if you want a second opinion on your patches, I can find some time to do reviews.",
