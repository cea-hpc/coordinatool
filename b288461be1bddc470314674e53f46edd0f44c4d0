      "message": "Yes, this patch just sets ct_state.client_id in the client, but the previous one(s) send the client_id to the server immediately after connect (new ehlo protocol message) -- I\u0027d much prefer using that for client-\u003ehost rather than sockaddr2str, and you can safely assert it has to be set in order for recv to work (just need to add ehlo for the cli client before it sends recv.. I didn\u0027t want it to trigger recovery mechanisms so it doesn\u0027t normally send one)\nThat\u0027ll avoid problems we can have with full network hostname on different interfaces (e.g. connecting over admin subnet but transfers over a data backbone), and that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t rely on sockaddr2str there. I didn\u0027t store it in the client struct because I had no immediate use for it outside of the ehlo reply handler, but that\u0027s trivial to add.\n\n(Note the addr should still be kept for logs, we\u0027ll want to at least match the two once for debug logs, then the addr can be freed eventually)\n\n\nI hadn\u0027t read this patch fully, the part with the coordinatool hostname can definitely be kept too, although I\u0027m not sure what it\u0027s used for? but that might make more sense after reading the other patch in detail.",

      "message": "The main difference between assuming that the coordinatool\u0027s host can do phobos operations or not is that, in the first case, you will send requests to a client that will never execute them, whereas in the second one, you could send commands to the coordinatool\u0027s host but you don\u0027t. So you\u0027re not as efficient as you can be but at least it works.\n\nIf you want, I think I can implement this in a following patch using the ping feature which would try to contact the LRS and fail if it is not up. This could set a boolean option in the state struct and return true in can_send_to_client() if this ping failed. This ping could later be put in a library alongside locate.\nThis solution is not complete because there could be a LRS with no devices which I guess is an admin issue, not a developper one.\n\nAlso, after thinking about it, I think, if we want to support phobos we have to be able to do so dynamically because we don\u0027t know until runtime if a client will be a phobos one.\n\nSo I think we have to use a custom library for that and probably a new protocol message which would send the client\u0027s type (e.g. which library to use on the server side if necessary). It may be better to discuss it before removing phobos code at compile time (which I think can only be a temporary fix unfortunatly).",

I named it ehlo because it\u0027s a fun name but we can rename it \"capabilities\" or similar, it\u0027s already something I had in mind. If something the server replies expects yet another reply we can use the same ehlo and it\u0027ll keep working as we track client states.\nThe easiest approach would be to feed the whole json to plugins so you can just extend it as you like (e.g. add `\u0027phobos\u0027: true` to the request for example)\n\nHmm. That does mean we also need the LD_PRELOAD client to support plugins on its own to know what it needs to announce though, I hadn\u0027t thought of that...\nSimpler ideas: just expose in the server config a list or nodeset pattern of client hostnames that support phobos?
