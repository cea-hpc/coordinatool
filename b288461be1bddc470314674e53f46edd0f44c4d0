      "message": "Yes, this patch just sets ct_state.client_id in the client, but the previous one(s) send the client_id to the server immediately after connect (new ehlo protocol message) -- I\u0027d much prefer using that for client-\u003ehost rather than sockaddr2str, and you can safely assert it has to be set in order for recv to work (just need to add ehlo for the cli client before it sends recv.. I didn\u0027t want it to trigger recovery mechanisms so it doesn\u0027t normally send one)\nThat\u0027ll avoid problems we can have with full network hostname on different interfaces (e.g. connecting over admin subnet but transfers over a data backbone), and that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t rely on sockaddr2str there. I didn\u0027t store it in the client struct because I had no immediate use for it outside of the ehlo reply handler, but that\u0027s trivial to add.\n\n(Note the addr should still be kept for logs, we\u0027ll want to at least match the two once for debug logs, then the addr can be freed eventually)\n\n\nI hadn\u0027t read this patch fully, the part with the coordinatool hostname can definitely be kept too, although I\u0027m not sure what it\u0027s used for? but that might make more sense after reading the other patch in detail.",
