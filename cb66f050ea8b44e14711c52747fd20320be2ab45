      "message": "Sorry for delay on review. I\u0027m not familiar with the new phobos API but atexit is full of pitfalls, I\u0027d rather we add the phobos_fini in the cleanup code (`out:` label below), and add a signal handler for TERM/INT that makes `ct_start` main loop exit on signal to make sure we call it on service stop (note atexit hooks aren\u0027t called on exit from signal either, so it doesn\u0027t help with that)\n\nThe coordinatool side of the tree is a \"normal process\" and we don\u0027t fork or anything so I don\u0027t expect any problem with this version, just something to cleanup eventually.",

This is not a big deal for now since phobos_fini only does some simple cleanup currently (free some memory and destroy a mutex). This is something that was added to fix a bug in Phobos\u0027 module system.",
