      "message": "sysconfdir is /etc, so this is fine as far as the value goes -- if anything, the spec file should usese %{_sysconfdir}/sysconfig for the service config above.\n\nFor the meson.build, as a nice to have we could define a variable for /etc like systemd does https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/meson.build#L9\n - add sysconfdir\u003d/etc in the project\u0027s default_options\n - use `get_option(\u0027sysconfdir\u0027)` here and for the sysconfig\n \n... with that said I was about to write I\u0027m not convinced we want to install coordinatool.conf here (the rpm has `(noreplace)` to make the config file not override any pre-existing config file, but running `ninja install` naively would overwrite the config every time, and I don\u0027t see any option in meson to not overwrite an existing file), so it\u0027d probably be more appropriate to keep a couple of cp in the spec, but we\u0027re doing it for the sysconfig too, so I guess this is fine with me.",
