      "message": "Looking at the HPSS copytool, they log both when the request is first received alongside a request ID that is unique to each request. This request ID is then used in other logs to track it. Maybe you can use a similar approach by using the memory address of the HAI for instance.\n\nThe copytool also uses the \"fuid\" (trusted.hsm_fuid xattr). But this would mean reading an extra attribute just for logging. So maybe not the best approach.",

      "message": "Thank you!\n\nRight now most lifecycle logs (enqueue/send) log dfid+cookie (which is unique.. per mdt?)\nI think admins like fids the most because it\u0027s easy to get the path back from it, might just need to add hai_fid as well as dfid at enqueue time so the info is there if it is useful\n\nI agree we probably don\u0027t want to get the fuid xattr, especially since it might not be set yet (afaiu the archive request will set it?)\n\nFor now St√©phane hasn\u0027t complained about this so I\u0027ll just assume the current fid being logged is good enough and forget about this :p",
