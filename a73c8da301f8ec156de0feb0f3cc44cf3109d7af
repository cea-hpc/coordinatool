This request ID is then used in other logs to track it. Maybe you can use a similar approach by using the memory address of the HAI for instance.\n\nThe copytool also uses the \"fuid\" (trusted.hsm_fuid xattr). But this would mean reading an extra attribute just for logging. So maybe not the best approach.",
