      "message": "question: isn\u0027t it dangerous to put a free here? It means that we have to make sure that each call to getenv_str has *val \u003d\u003d NULL or something returned by malloc. It\u0027s easy to forget the initialization and just write:\n\n```\nchar *value;\n\ngetenv_str(\"my_var\", \u0026value);\n```\n\nThat being said, I don\u0027t have strong feelings against this so feel free to keep it this way if you find it simpler.",
