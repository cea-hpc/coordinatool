      "message": "I had to change this because han-\u003equeues-\u003eactions_tree is never initialized since we never add any cookie into the per-client tree. It seems to me that the client\u0027s tree is not useful since we want to have a global tree which contains every cookie. It doesn\u0027t make sense to me to have a tree per client.\n\nI saw this bug because I\u0027m now changing han-\u003equeues to \u0026client-\u003equeues in the enrich phase. Which means that han-\u003equeues here can refer to client-\u003equeues which is empty and raises the abort bellow.",
